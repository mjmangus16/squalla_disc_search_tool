    "description": "Lower your score with the MD4! The much anticipated MD4 release is finally upon us. Let's just say it was worth the wait. This disc is the overstable brother of the MD3. The MD4 has a blunt nose with that standard MD3 micro-bead giving it a familiar feel in the hand. Not only is the MD4 overstable, but it also has a surprising amount of glide, allowing your shots to fade more while still maintaining predictability. Whether you're facing a stiff wind, looking for a controlled hyzer line, or throwing a nice touch sidearm, the MD4 has you covered. We find this disc to be much more versatile than most other overstable mid-ranges on the market due to the mix of stability and glide. Don't wait, grab yourself an MD4 and lower your score!",

Compared with the existing Prodigy Driver line, the X1 has a substantially thinner profile. This disc is nearly half a centimeter shorter than the D1 standing just 1.5cm tall. The X1 has the same 2.3cm wing length of all the other Prodigy distance drivers.",

The rim of the Prometheus also pushes the limits on width. The only PDGA approved disc with a wider wing, than the 2.6cm Prometheus, is the Aerobie Epic. The only disc to rival the Prometheus in dimensions is the non-PDGA-approved Gateway Ninja.
